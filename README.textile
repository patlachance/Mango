h1. Mango

Mango is a web admin written in PHP for MongoDB.

*This in not production ready!*

There are still some issues, that prevent it from being used in a production environment such as XSS vulnerabilities and other security issues.

h3. Mongo_DB Library

The library was originally written for CodeIgniter by *Alex Bilbie* and can be "downloaded here":http://bitbucket.org/alexbilbie/codeigniter-mongo-library/wiki/Home.  I have modified the library to make it work outside of CodeIgniter, as well as added a few functions.

h2. Installation

Just drop the files anywhere on your server available to view a web browser.

Then just point your web browser to the index.php file.  Default username is "demo" and the password is "password" (sorry, the login form isn't pretty right now).

h2. Configuration

The only config you will need to do is edit the $auth in index.php (its documented in there).

If you need to change the connection parameters you will also find those at the top of index.php.
